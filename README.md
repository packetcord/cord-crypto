## Components

### Implemented Components

#### AES Cipher Implementation
**[cord-aes-cipher](https://github.com/packetcord/cord-aes-cipher)** - Hardware-accelerated AES encryption

- **AES-128/192/256** support with configurable key lengths
- **Hardware acceleration** via AES-NI (x86-64) and NEON (ARM)
- **Software fallback** for platforms without hardware acceleration
- **Embedded-friendly** with configurable memory usage
- **Cross-platform** design for servers to microcontrollers

### Planned Components

#### Cipher Modes
- **AES-CBC** - Cipher Block Chaining mode
- **AES-CTR** - Counter mode for stream-like encryption  
- **AES-ECB** - Electronic Codebook mode
- **AES-GCM** - Galois/Counter Mode with authentication

#### Stream Ciphers
- **ChaCha20** - Modern stream cipher
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** - Authenticated encryption
